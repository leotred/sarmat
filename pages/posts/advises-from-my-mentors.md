## Becoming better engineer

- **Don’t be in a corner** and think that things will get done by themselves, because they will not. 
- **Be proactive**. Learn more and make sure you are always ahead of everyone in the meetings.
- **Always take one meeting more** for every confusion you have.
- **Read things that have passed test-of-time** (i.e Refactoring by Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob etc.) and don’t read random articles on Medium or other forums.
- **Always take the first step!** Never be the one sitting and waiting for others to do stuff for you.
- **Ask questions for clarification.** Do not do anything unless you are crystal clear about it.
- **Never switch off your critical thinking!** Do not think that something is concrete and cannot be changed. Nobody is God, anyone can make mistakes.
- **Be simple as possible in your documentation.** There’s a difference between ‘being simple’ and ‘being simple as possible’. Make sure your knowledge is transferred exactly as you wanted it to be. 
- **While developing products, don’t code for yourself, but for the team.** Make sure every perspective is thought-through.
- **Never assume things.** Assumptions are very dangerous! Always make sure what you’re doing makes sense and do it by asking lots and lots of questions. 
- **Learn to praise.** Praising and appreciating your mentor or juniors makes them more confident. No one hates praising.
- **Show off what you build.** There’s nothing wrong with bragging about your skills. Keep yourself in the limelight.
- **Don’t get scared of error logs.** Software programs are written for facilitation of the programmers so take the information from error logs to solve your problem.
- **Don’t try to do everything you’re assigned to.** Complete the tasks you are currently working on and let the assigner know priority of your tasks. InProgress tasks have higher priority than the tasks that you haven’t started. 
- **Feedback is important while communication.** “Okay”, “Got it” etc. is not enough. Make proper feedback sentences like “I understand, so it should be…”. This shows your attention.
- **Improve communication skills.** Make sure you don’t mumble and your words are loudly and clearly pronounced.
- **Be precise in what you write.** Repetition is bad but making sure what you write covers all scenarios is important. Don’t become a storyteller too.
- **Always be suspicious about yourself.** If something works and you’re 100% sure it will work on all cases, you’re wrong. 
- **Code that you did not run has errors!**
- **A bug is an assumption that is wrong.**
- Robustness Principle: **“be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others”.**
